GitHub Repository Analysis

This script analyzes GitHub repositories and identifies the most technically complex one based on code complexity metrics. 
It uses the Hugging Face GPT-2 language model to generate a justification for the selection.

Prerequisites

To run the script, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

*Python 3.x
*requests library
*nbconvert library
*transformers library
*langchain library

You can install the dependencies using pip:

pip install requests nbconvert transformers langchain

Usage
1.Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.

2.Open the script analyze_github_repositories.py.

3.Modify the 'model_name' variable if you want to use a different Hugging Face model.

4.Run the script using the command python 'analyze_github_repositories.py'.

5.Enter the GitHub user URL when prompted.

6.The script will analyze the repositories, identify the most technically complex one, and generate a justification for the selection.

7.The most complex repository URL and the generated justification will be displayed.

Note: The script will clone repositories temporarily, preprocess Jupyter notebooks to Python files, evaluate code complexity using the LangChain library, 
and make use of the Hugging Face GPT-2 model for justification generation.
